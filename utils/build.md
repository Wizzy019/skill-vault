1. Base Setup

Create the React app (Vite or CRA, whichever you prefer).

Set up folder structure: components, pages, assets, utils.

Add React Router and set up routes for:

/dashboard

/goals

/projects

/profile

Goal: You understand routing, layout components, and structure.

---

2. Dashboard Page

Create a summary view that shows:

Total tasks

Completed tasks

Active goals

Progress charts (use something like Recharts or Chart.js).

Mock some data in a JSON file first.

Goal: Work with state, mapping data, and props.

---

3. Goals / Habit Tracker

Add, edit, delete goals.

Mark progress with a toggle or slider.

Store progress in localStorage.

Goal: Practice CRUD logic, hooks (useState, useEffect), and local persistence.

---

4. Projects / Portfolio Section

A card layout of projects you’ve done.

Each card: project name, image, short description, and link.

Add filtering (e.g. by category: React, Design, etc.)

Goal: Conditional rendering, filtering lists, reusable components.

---

5. Profile Page

Static info: photo, name, “About Me,” contact links.

Optional: editable fields that update state.

Goal: Forms, input handling, optional validation.

---

6. Optional Power-ups

Dark/light mode toggle (context or custom hook).

Save user preferences in localStorage.

Animate page transitions (Framer Motion).

If you’re feeling bold: link Firebase for real auth + storage.
